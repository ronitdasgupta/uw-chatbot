CSE 414: Introduction To Database Systems,Ryan Maas,5/5,NA,3.39
CSE 373: Data Structures and Algorithms,Kevin Lin,2.2/5,"""Will resort to ""because I said so / because the course is structured this way"" instead of changing his mind. Absurdly narrow-minded for his age haha."", ""Not a good professor. This class is important if you plan to pursue a career in the industry but we learned absolutely nothing due to the fact that the class content and TA's were all over the place"", ""Absolutely horrible professor. Although I got a high grade in this class (whole class is project based) I felt like I learnt nothing and am planning on retaking. All the classes included prelectures that were very boring to read and just linked to hunters lectures, and then in class work was just solving different problems in a very arbitrary way""",3.21
MATH 124: Calculus With Analytic Geomtery I,Fanny Dos Reis,2.9/5,NA,2.85
CSE 351: The Hardware/Software Interface,Justin Hsia,4.5/5,"""I loved taking CSE 351 my first quarter at UW. There were a lot of labs and it's incredibly different from the CSE intro series. Justin's lectures are really fun and his class is extremely organized, everything is laid out on ed. This class is very time demanding, I spent most of my time on labs. If you want an A, aim for high grades (95%+)."", ""One of the best professors I've had at UW. Hsia is amazing at teaching and prepares you incredibly well for CSE 333. He also prioritizes learning over grading harshly, so I felt that I was able to get a lot out of this class. Try to take CSE 333 with Hsia right after taking CSE 351."", ""Justin really cares about his students! His class is not only very well organized on Ed, but his lectures are also very well organized. The labs definitely take a while, but I overall enjoyed the class!""",3.39
CHEM 142: General Chemistry,Charles J Barrows,3.6/5,"""I liked the way he structured his lectures, in general a very approachable professor when it comes to asking questions during office hours or after lectures."", ""Barrows was a good prof for 142. Overall, the course wasn't extremely difficult, but there were a few things about his class that were not ideal. He had 5 tests, one of which was 5 days before the final. He also isn't the best at explaining concepts. That being said, his practice test/questions are the SAME as the actual tests. He's also very nice!"", ""He was alright, he had good lectures, I have heard he moved away from that for 152. His tests were extremely difficult with missing one problem taking off 5 percent from the whole test, and 5 tests was too much. Overall, a good lecturer however he has some problems with how he treats the kids in his class, he did not treat me like a human being.""",2.77
